# Spring-React OAuth2 Authentication Template

Welcome to my authentication template! This is an authentication system developed using React on the front end and Spring Boot on the back end, designed to simplify the implementation of login and authentication features for developers in their projects.


# Requirement
1. Docker-compose 1.27.4
2. Docker 23.0.3


## Key Features

1. **Front-end  React:**
   Utilizes the React front-end framework to provide a modern, intuitive, and efficient user interface, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate authentication features into their projects.

2. **Back-end   Spring Boot:**
   Employs the Spring Boot back-end framework, offering robust support for security, stability, and performance. This ensures the system can handle complex authentication requirements effectively.

3. **Comprehensive Authentication Features:**
      The template provides a full range of authentication features, including account registration, login, password reset emails, and support for third-party logins.
    
     - **Google and Facebook OAuth Support:**
     Easily integrate Google and Facebook OAuth for seamless third-party login experiences. Users can sign in using their Google or Facebook credentials, enhancing user convenience.
