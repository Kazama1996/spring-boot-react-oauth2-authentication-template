Welcome to my authentication template! This is an authentication system developed using React on the front end and Spring Boot on the back end, designed to simplify the implementation of login and authentication features for developers in their projects.


# Requirement
1. Docker-compose 1.27.4
2. Docker 23.0.3


## Key Features

1. **Front-end  React:**
   Utilizes the React front-end framework to provide a modern, intuitive, and efficient user interface, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate authentication features into their projects.

2. **Back-end   Spring Boot:**
   Employs the Spring Boot back-end framework, offering robust support for security, stability, and performance. This ensures the system can handle complex authentication requirements effectively.

3. **Comprehensive Authentication Features:**
      The template provides a full range of authentication features, including account registration, login, password reset emails, and support for third-party (Google,Github) logins.

4. **JWT Authorization:**
   The system uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to store authorization information in cookies, ensuring identity security. JWT provides a lightweight, cross-platform authentication solution that effectively manages the user's login status.

## How to Use

1. Go to the project directory 
2. `./deploy.sh` to launch the application
3. Open your browser and in the address bar at the top enter http://localhost:3000
